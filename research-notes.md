# Password Security Research Notes

## Common Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attacks
**Definition:** Systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

**How it works:**
- Starts with simple combinations (a, b, c, aa, ab, ac...)
- Progresses through increasingly complex combinations
- Success depends entirely on password length and character set size
- Modern tools can try millions of combinations per second

**Attack Progression:**
1. **Single characters**: a-z, A-Z, 0-9
2. **Two characters**: aa, ab, ac... zz, AA, AB... 99
3. **Three characters**: aaa, aab... zzz, AAA... 999
4. **Continues until password found**

**Time Estimates Based on Our Testing:**
- **4-character password (like "1234")**: Milliseconds to seconds
- **4-character mixed (like "1@3#")**: Minutes to hours
- **10-character mixed (like "1@3#coffee")**: Days to months
- **22-character passphrase**: Centuries with current technology

**Protection Strategies:**
- Use passwords minimum 12 characters (exponentially harder to crack)
- Account lockouts after failed attempts
- Rate limiting and CAPTCHA systems
- Multi-factor authentication as backup protection

**Real-World Impact:**
Our testing shows why "1234" achieved only 4% strength - it would be among the first passwords attempted in any brute force attack.

### 2. Dictionary Attacks
**Definition:** Using pre-compiled lists of common passwords, dictionary words, and known password patterns.

**Attack Process:**
1. **Common password lists**: password, 123456, qwerty, admin
2. **Dictionary words**: All words from standard dictionaries
3. **Common substitutions**: p@ssw0rd, passw0rd!, P@ssword123
4. **Pattern combinations**: word+numbers, word+year, word+symbols
5. **Leaked passwords**: From previous data breaches

**Common Password Sources:**
- **RockYou breach**: 14 million real passwords leaked in 2009
- **SecLists compilations**: Curated lists of common passwords
- **Have I Been Pwned**: 613+ million compromised passwords
- **Regional variations**: Common passwords by country/language

**Why Our Test Results Matter:**
- **"1@3#coffee"** scored lower partially due to "coffee" being a dictionary word
- **"Coffee$Makes2Me4Happy!"** overcame this through length and substitutions
- Dictionary attacks fail against sufficient length even with word inclusion

**Protection Methods:**
- Avoid common dictionary words entirely (when possible)
- Use multiple random words with substitutions (passphrase approach)
- Implement organizational password blacklists
- Regular password strength auditing

### 3. Credential Stuffing
**Definition:** Automatically testing username/password combinations from data breaches across multiple websites.

**Why It's Effective:**
- **65% of users reuse passwords** across multiple accounts
- **Automated tools** test millions of credential pairs per hour
- **Large-scale attacks** using distributed botnets
- **High success rates** due to password reuse habits

**Attack Methodology:**
1. **Obtain breach data**: Username/password pairs from previous attacks
2. **Target selection**: Popular websites and services
3. **Automated testing**: Rapid-fire login attempts across multiple sites
4. **Account takeover**: Successful logins lead to account compromise
5. **Data harvesting**: Personal information, financial data, further credentials

**Real-World Examples:**
- **2018 Dunkin' Donuts**: Credential stuffing affected customer accounts
- **2019 Disney+**: Launch week attacks using recycled credentials
- **2020 Zoom**: 500,000+ credentials sold on dark web

**Protection Strategies:**
- **Unique passwords** for every single account
- **Password managers** to generate and store unique credentials
- **Account monitoring** for unusual login activity
- **Device fingerprinting** and location-based alerts
- **Mandatory MFA** for sensitive accounts

### 4. Rainbow Table Attacks
**Definition:** Using precomputed tables of password hashes to quickly reverse-engineer original passwords from stolen hash databases.

**Technical Process:**
1. **Hash generation**: Compute hashes for millions of common passwords
2. **Table creation**: Store passwordâ†’hash relationships in massive databases
3. **Hash comparison**: Compare stolen hashes against rainbow table entries
4. **Instant lookup**: Find matches without real-time computation
5. **Password recovery**: Retrieve original password from hash match

**Why They Work:**
- **Speed advantage**: No real-time computation needed
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Tables include millions of password variants
- **Hash algorithm targeting**: Specific tables for MD5, SHA1, etc.
- **Space-time tradeoff**: Large storage for fast retrieval

**Protection Mechanisms:**
1. **Salted hashes**: Add random data to each password before hashing
2. **Strong algorithms**: Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 instead of MD5/SHA1
3. **Unique salts**: Different random salt for each password
4. **Computational cost**: Algorithms designed to be slow/expensive
5. **Regular updates**: Migrate to stronger algorithms periodically

**Connection to Our Testing:**
Even our 100% strength password would be vulnerable if stored with weak hashing. This emphasizes why both strong passwords AND proper technical implementation are essential.

- **Length advantage**: Each additional word exponentially increases security
- **Substitution benefits**: Character replacements add complexity without memorability loss

**Diceware Method:**
- **Random word selection**: Use dice rolls to select words from curated lists
- **Guaranteed entropy**: Each word adds ~12.9 bits of entropy
- **Memorability**: Word combinations create narrative possibilities
- **Customization**: Add personal substitutions while maintaining base security

### Practical Implementation
**Our Successful Example Analysis:**
"Coffee$Makes2Me4Happy!" demonstrates ideal passphrase construction:
- **Base phrase**: "Coffee Makes Me Happy" (relatable, memorable)
- **Character substitutions**: $ for S, 2 for "to", 4 for "for"
- **Length achievement**: 22 characters for maximum security
- **Typing efficiency**: Faster than random character strings
- **Perfect score**: 100% strength while remaining memorable

**Construction Guidelines:**
1. **Start with 4-6 random words** or a memorable phrase
2. **Add meaningful substitutions**: $ for S, @ for a, 3 for e
3. **Include numbers naturally**: 2 for "to", 4 for "for", 8 for "ate"
4. **Punctuation integration**: Natural sentence endings or emphasis
5. **Length targeting**: Aim for 15+ characters minimum

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Famous quotes**: Avoid well-known phrases that appear in databases
- **Personal information**: Don't use names, birthdays, or addresses
- **Simple patterns**: Avoid predictable substitutions like all aâ†’@

- **Complexity over length**: Believing symbols can replace adequate length
- **Minimum compliance**: Meeting requirements exactly rather than exceeding them
- **Legacy habits**: Continuing to use old, short passwords

**Pattern-Related Errors:**
- **Sequential characters**: 1234, abcd, qwerty patterns
- **Dictionary words**: Using common words without adequate modification
- **Personal information**: Names, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers
- **Keyboard patterns**: qwerty, asdf, 123456, password variations
- **Predictable substitutions**: Simple @ for a, 3 for e without other changes

**Reuse and Management Errors:**
- **Password reuse**: Same password across multiple accounts (enables credential stuffing)
- **Minor variations**: password1, password2, password3 across sites
- **Insecure storage**: Writing passwords on paper, storing in browsers without master passwords
- **Sharing practices**: Telling passwords to others, sending via insecure channels
- **Update resistance**: Never changing passwords, even after breach notifications

**Security Practice Failures:**
- **No MFA usage**: Relying solely on passwords for account security
- **Ignoring breach notices**: Not changing passwords after security incidents
- **Weak recovery options**: Using easily guessable security questions
- **Public computer use**: Entering passwords on untrusted devices
- **Social engineering susceptibility**: Revealing passwords through manipulation

### Organizational Policy Mistakes
**Counterproductive Requirements:**
- **Excessive complexity rules**: Requiring so many character types that users create predictable patterns
- **Forced frequent changes**: Mandatory 30/60/90-day changes without security justification
- **Maximum length limits**: Artificially capping password length (often due to legacy systems)
- **No passphrase allowance**: Policies that effectively prohibit secure passphrase approaches
- **Uniform requirements**: Same rules for all accounts regardless of sensitivity level

**Implementation Failures:**
- **No tool provision**: Requiring strong passwords without providing password managers
- **Inadequate training**: Policy implementation without user education
- **Poor technical implementation**: Storing passwords insecurely despite strong user requirements
- **Inconsistent enforcement**: Different rules across different systems within the same organization
- **No breach response planning**: Inadequate procedures for password compromise incidents

**Management and Monitoring Failures:**
- **No password auditing**: Failing to regularly assess password strength across the organization
- **Weak account recovery**: Insecure password reset processes that bypass strong password requirements
- **No monitoring systems**: Missing detection for unusual login patterns or brute force attempts
- **Inadequate incident response**: Poor handling of password-related security incidents
